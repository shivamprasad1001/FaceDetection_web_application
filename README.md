# Face Detection

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Face Detection" project! This tool allows users to detect faces in images using computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

The "Face Detection" tool is a web application that helps users identify faces in uploaded images. It uses advanced machine learning models to accurately detect and highlight faces.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in uploaded images.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Highlight detected faces with bounding boxes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for an excellent user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the logic and interactivity of the app.
- **Python**: For the backend processing and face detection logic.
- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision to perform face detection.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python to create the web server.
    ```
    
## Usage

1. Open the "Face Detection" tool in your web browser.
2. Upload an image using the provided upload button.
3. Click the "Detect Faces" button to process the image.
4. View the results with detected faces highlighted in bounding boxes.
